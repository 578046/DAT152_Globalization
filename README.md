Exercise 2 – Globalization


A small web application that contains some elements similar to a webstore.
The application has three pages, see the examples below for views in different languages:


Home (/home) - index.jsp

Product Page (/store) - store.jsp

Cart (/cart) - cart.jsp

Data on products conceivably stored in a "database". Relational model for the database:
Product (pno, pName, priceInEuro, imageFile)
Description (pno, langCode, text), FK pno -> product.pno


Application Requirements:
• The application must follow the MVC pattern. Try to distribute responsibilities in a
correct manner between Model (Product (s) and Cart), Views (JSP), Controllers (Servlets)
and classes.
• The application must support three different locations, each consisting of language +
country.
• The application must be internationalized so that there is only one JSP per web page.
• The application must be internationalized so that a new place can be added without
having to change the code. (Not easy to get this to 100%. Try as best you can.)
• Application texts should be stored in a resource bundle (properties files).
• The amounts must be converted from Euros (reference value) to the correct value for
selected country.
• JSTL/fmt should be used to display general application texts and for formatting data.
• Initial location should be obtained from a cookie, or. HTTP header if no cookie is set.
• When you change location during a session a cookie should be sent to the client.
• It is not necessary to use a database system (RDBMS). It's okay to make a mock DAO
containing hard-coded data about products and product descriptions.
• The application must know which locations that are supported, ie it must be an object that
gives this information.
• Copyright-line shall be generated by a custom tag.
Example: <T:copyright since="2008"> HVL </ T:copyright> shall give © MMVIIIMMXXI HVL (ie the “since year” and the current year shall be written in Roman
numerals)
• Product descriptions in the database can be arbitrarily long. In the carts summary, we
want to limit the length of these descriptions. You must create a custom tag for this.
Example:
• <T:shorttext maxchars = "10"> asødlk aøsdlkaøslølskdøaksdøaksd </ T:shorttext>
• shall give asødlk aøs ... (ie 10 characters of text plus "spacde dot dot dot"). If the text is
shorter than "maxchars", the entire text is returned as it is.
• Otherwise, there should be minimal cut and paste in the code.
